Great, since you've created the components, the next logical step would be to start integrating them into a cohesive application. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. **Set Up Routing**: If you haven't already, set up routing for your application using a library like `react-router`. This will allow you to navigate between different components and pages.

2. **Create Layout Structure**: Design a layout structure for your application. You might have a main layout component that includes a navigation bar, content area, and possibly a footer.

3. **Integrate Components**: Place your created components into the appropriate sections of your layout. For example, you can have the `Navbar` component in the navigation area and the `Dashboard`, `AttendanceTracking`, and other components in the content area.

4. **Implement Navigation**: Use routing to navigate between different components. When a user clicks on a navigation link, the corresponding component should be displayed.

5. **Test Interactions**: Start testing interactions between components. For example, if you have a "Dashboard" component, ensure that it fetches data and displays it correctly. Similarly, test the interactions of the other components.

6. **Data Flow**: Plan how data will flow through your components. If a component requires data from the backend, set up API calls and state management to handle this.

7. **State Management**: If your components need to share state or manage complex application-wide state, consider implementing a state management solution like Redux or React Context.

8. **Backend Integration**: Start connecting your frontend to the backend. If you're using a database, set up API routes for fetching and updating data. Test these API calls from your frontend components.

9. **Authentication**: If your application requires user authentication, implement login and registration functionality. Use tokens or sessions to manage authenticated user sessions.

10. **Styling and Design**: Apply consistent styling to your components. Ensure that your application has a cohesive and visually appealing design. Consider using CSS frameworks or UI libraries for faster styling.

11. **Testing**: Write tests for your components and functionality. Test user interactions, data fetching, and other critical parts of your application.

12. **Deployment**: When you're satisfied with the functionality and design, deploy your application to a hosting platform. Make sure your backend is also deployed, and the frontend can communicate with it.

13. **Iterate and Refine**: Launch your application for testing or a limited audience. Gather feedback and use it to refine your application. Fix bugs, enhance user experience, and add features based on feedback.

Remember that building a complete application involves multiple steps and iterations. Take one step at a time and make sure each component is working correctly before moving on to the next one.
